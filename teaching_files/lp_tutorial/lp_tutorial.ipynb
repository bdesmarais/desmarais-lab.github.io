    "# Link Prediction Tutorial using the LinkPred Library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Link prediction is a common task in network analysis where we aim to predict the presence or absence of links (edges) between nodes in a network. The LinkPred library in Python provides various algorithms and methods to perform link prediction on network data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the LinkPred library to predict the missing values in the adjacency matrix of the GirlsNA network dataset stored as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we begin, make sure you have the LinkPred library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install linkpred\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing the Required Libraries\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to perform link prediction on a network dataset stored as an adjacency matrix in a CSV file using the LinkPred library in Python.     We loaded the GirlsNA network dataset, prepared it as a networkx graph object, performed link prediction using the CommonNeighbours algorithm, and evaluated the predictions by comparing them with the missing values in the original dataset.

    You can further explore other link prediction algorithms available in the LinkPred library and experiment with different network datasets to gain more insights into link prediction tasks.
