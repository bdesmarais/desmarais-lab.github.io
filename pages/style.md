title: Code Style
type: resource

To make our code readable, which in turn facilitates the finding of bugs and eases software maintenance, we define acceptable [code styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style), that is, the manner in which code is written beyond that enforced by the language itself.

We most commonly use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and C++.

For R we specify adherance to the [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) group's [style guide](https://github.com/rdatsci/PackagesInfo/wiki/R-Style-Guide).

For Python we use [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

For C++ we use Google's [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
