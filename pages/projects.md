title: Projects

Organizational Responsiveness to Open Outside Input
Sponsor: National Science Foundation
Period: 2013–2016
This project focuses on the development of new analytical tools for modeling the relationships between intra-organizational communication networks and open, external sources of text data. The massive quantities of textual communications generated within organizations constitute a largely untapped source for insightful, timely organizational analytics. The tools under development for this project are designed to jointly analyze the content of communications and the socio-organizational structure comprised by communication ties.

Scientific Evidence in Regulation and Governance
Sponsor: National Science Foundation
Period: 2014–2017
Public policymaking is enhanced through access to the best possible science. Central to the project is the development of the first large-scale, publicly available database that connects specific policies to specific scientific sources, allowing comparisons across time, policymaking domains, and scientific disciplines. This database better illuminates the basis of regulatory impact assessments, reveals how science is presented to policymakers, and provides scientific researchers as well as their funders with concrete evidence of real-world policy impact.

Specification and Estimation of Generalized ERGMs
Sponsor: National Science Foundation
Period: 2014–2016
The generalized exponential random graph model (GERGM) is a powerful tool for formulating and testing hypotheses about weighted networks. This project advances the current state of development of the GERGM by (1) developing a better understanding of the space of distributions that can be formulated with the GERGM; developing MCMC methods for estimation, which will broaden the class of available GERGM specifications; (3) developing constraints that facilitate the study of correlation matrices as networks; and (4) developing asymptotic theory of GERGM.

The Revolving Door in Financial Regulation
Sponsor: Russell Sage Foundation
Period: 2014–2016
We model the revolving door as a social network and assess the variable levels of advocacy success of interest groups who lobby over financial regulation designed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The project employs data from personnel flows, lobbying and regulatory policy documents, and then utilizes best practice techniques to measure advocacy success, to control for confounding variables and to maximize causal inference within a social network analytical frame.
