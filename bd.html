In contrast to the standard conception of a U.S. Supreme Court striving to produce ideologically optimal case outcomes, I theorize that the Court uses cases to construct an ideologically optimal body of law. The Court aims to influence behavior of legal entities such as administrative agencies and lower courts. These actors typically take direction from a collection of cases and not single, isolated decisions, thus creating an incentive for the Supreme Court to target an ideologically ideal body of law rather than ideal cases. A Court directly concerned with the integrated collection of cases uses current decisions to correct the ideological bias of past terms -- resulting in an inverse relationship between the ideological composition of past cases and the liberalism of the current term. Consistent with this implication, analysis of the 1953-2008 terms reveals an inverse relationship between the liberalism of past cases and that of the current term.
