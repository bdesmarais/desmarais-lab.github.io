A detailed picture of any diffusion process can be achieved only when both a detailed network structure and individual diffusion pathways are obtained. Studying such diffusion networks provides valuable insights to understand important actors in carrying and spreading contagions and to help predict occurrences of new infections. Most prior research focuses on modeling diffusion process only in the temporal dimension. The advent of rich social, media and geo-tagged data now allows us to study and model this diffusion process in both temporal and spatial dimensions than previously possible. Nevertheless, how information, ideas or diseases are propagated through the network as an overall spatiotemporal process is difficult to trace. This propagation is continuous over time and space, where individual transmissions occur at different rates via complex and latent connections.To tackle this challenge, a probabilistic spatiotemporal algorithm for network diffusion simulation (STAND) is developed based on the survival model in this research. Both time and geographic distance are used as explanatory variables to simulate the diffusion process over two different network structures. The aim is to provide a more detailed measure of how different contagions are transmitted through various networks where nodes denote geographic locations at a large scale.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on GeoSpatial Simulation}, pages = {20–29}, numpages = {10}, keywords = {spatiotemporal diffusion, survival model, network analysis, probabilistic function}, location = {Seattle, Washington}, series = {GeoSim '20} }

    abstract = { Theories in political science are most commonly tested through comparisons of means via difference tests or regression, but some theoretical frameworks offer implications regarding other distributional features. I consider the literature on models of policy change, and their implications for the thickness of the tails in the distribution of policy change. Change in public policy output is commonly characterized by periods of stasis that are punctuated by dramatic change—a heavy-tailed distribution of policy change. Heavy-tailed policy change is used to differentiate between the incrementalism and punctuated equilibrium models of policy change. The evidentiary value of heavy-tailed outputs rests on the assumption that changes in inputs are normally distributed. I show that, in order for conventional assumptions to imply normally distributed inputs, variance in the within-time distribution of inputs must be assumed to be constant over time. I present this result, and then present an empirical example of a possible aggregate policy input—a major public opinion survey item—that exhibits over-time variation in within-time variance. I conclude that the results I present should serve as motivation for those interested in testing the implications of punctuated equilibrium theory to adopt more flexible assumptions regarding, and endeavor to measure, policy inputs. }
